The whole idea is to create a login page with a login form,
where userwill have to enter right credentials to enter into website.

username = admin
password = admin

Above cred, is only allowed as of now.

2.
next idea is when user will submit the login form, we will check the login credentials, 
if those are correct, we will update the "isCorrect" property of object to "True".
